## Overview and warning
Collection of SBT plugins and settings used by all kantan.projects.

This _can_ be used by other projects (only the `kantan` module is strictly kantan specific), but bear in mind that I wrote this with
my own needs in mind, and it might not yet be generic enough to plug in seemlessly into other buildfiles.
